# A secure network
## General
How can a secure network be built with the same functions as demanded by the masses? This document is intended to serve as a basis and is to be adapted according to the current state of knowledge. This document should also look at the social impacts and solutions and show corresponding solutions.

## The problem
Today, most people are dependent on central companies and use their services without realizing that they have become the tool of companies why the products work and make a profit. If the users of these products decided from one day to the next to no longer use the products, these companies would not be functional from one day to the next and would have to register the bankrot. Another effect would be that the products would no longer work. Since the users are a building block of the products without them these important building blocks are missing.

## The consideration
In order to ensure sufficient security for users, the following points must be met.

No one can access the user information, not even the operator of the system.
The data must be stored so that the operator of the system cannot manipulate or view the data.
The system must be distributed so that there is not one operator but the operation takes place over many.
All information must be stored encrypted. The user / user has the possibility to change or release the data.
All communication must be encrypted. This is to ensure that the data cannot be viewed or changed on the way.
## Technology
### Communication
Communication must be encrypted. This means that all interfaces must be addressed encrypted. That no manipulation of the data can take place. This must be done on the basis of known methods, such as SSL/TLS. [^ SSL/ TLS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security]

### Storage
The data must be stored encrypted, which makes manipulation of the data more difficult or impossible.

### Cookies
Only cookies should be used that are necessary to process the user's data. This means to save his settings or to be able to work in the corresponding session. No cookies may be stored on the system and further processed in any way.

### Tracker
No advertising trackers or the like are used to possibly make a business with the user data.

### Advertising
No advertising is used or displayed. The exception here is advertising for your own system.

### Censor resistent â€Ž
Decentralized and permission-free

### Make money
Every user is fairly rewarded for what they bring to their followers

## Tools and Programs
### Search engine
The YaCy [^YaCy: https://yacy.net] project was found as a distributed search engine. It is characterized by the fact that the information is stored distributed from the beginning and the index is also queried distributed. The basis for search engine is a peer to peer network [^Peer to Peer Network: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-Peer]

### Payment and monetization
Based on this, the central system prevails to this day and thus the user is an element of this system, nothing will change in this basic concept, with the difference that the user should and will be paid for his work. This can be achieved by using a blockchain [^Crypto Currency: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency] and a crypto currency 5. This means in detail that when a user provides information or systems, he is paid and the system can continue to grow.
